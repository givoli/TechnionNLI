<div>Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to modify it in some way: removing numbers or changing their order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The task for your assistant is to make the desired modification happen. The following figure shows the list before and after the modification. For your convenience, all changes between the &quot;Current State&quot; and &quot;Desired State&quot; are emphasized by <span style="color:#FF0000;">red font</span> (your assistant does not see the red font, so don&#39;t mention it in your&nbsp;instruction).</div>
