<div>Suppose you are using your computer, and you decide to delete some files or move them to another directory (folder).</div>

<div>The task for your assistant is to delete or move files as defined by the figure below. You can see in the figure the files in each directory, and for each file you can see its name, type and size. For your convenience, all changes between the &quot;Current State&quot; and &quot;Desired State&quot; are emphasized by <span style="color:#FF0000;">red font </span>(your assistant does not see the red font, so don&#39;t mention it in your&nbsp;instruction).</div>
