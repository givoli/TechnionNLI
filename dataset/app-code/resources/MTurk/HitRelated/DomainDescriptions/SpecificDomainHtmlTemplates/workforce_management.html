<div>Suppose you own a small company and you want to make changes in the workforce. Each company employee has a given position, salary and a manger (except for the most senior one, which does not have a manager).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The task for your assistant is to make the desired change happen. In the following figure each row describes one of the employees. For your convenience, all changes between the &quot;Current State&quot; and &quot;Desired State&quot; are emphasized by <span style="color:#FF0000;">red font</span> (your assistant does not see the figure, so don&rsquo;t refer to it in your instruction).</div>
