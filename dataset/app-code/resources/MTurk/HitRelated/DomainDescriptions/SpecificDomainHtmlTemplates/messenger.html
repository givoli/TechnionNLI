<div>Suppose you are using a simple messaging app. The app shows you a list of chat groups that you&rsquo;re currently participating in. Each chat group may contain some of your contacts and additional participants (who you don&rsquo;t personally know). Also, a chat group can be muted (which disables notifications for new messages).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Suppose you want to take any of the following actions in the app: create a new chat group (with chosen contacts), delete chat groups or change chat groups to be muted or not.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The task for your assistant is to make the desired action happen. In the following figure each row describes one of your chat groups. For your convenience, all changes between the &quot;Current State&quot; and &quot;Desired State&quot; are emphasized by&nbsp;<span style="color:#FF0000;">red font</span>&nbsp;(your assistant does not see the red font, so don&#39;t mention it in your&nbsp;instruction).</div>
