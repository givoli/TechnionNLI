<div>Suppose you&nbsp;have a calendar, managed by some software (e.g. Outlook). Your calendar is simply a list of events, and each event has a title,&nbsp;date, location and possibly also a list of attendees. Also - each event is marked with&nbsp;a chosen color (in which it is displayed to you).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The task for your assistant is to modify your calendar as defined by the figure below. For your convenience, all changes between the &quot;Current State&quot; and &quot;Desired State&quot; are emphasized&nbsp;with an <span style="border-bottom: 0.13em solid;">underline</span> (your assistant does not see the underline - so don&#39;t mention it in your&nbsp;instruction).</div>
