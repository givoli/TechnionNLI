<div>Suppose you operate a container terminal with some shipping containers. The shipping containers come in different lengths, and each container is either loaded or empty. Suppose you wish to take one of the following actions: load/unload some containers or remove some containers from the terminal.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The task for your assistant is to carry out the desired action. The following figure shows the current and desired state of the terminal, each represented by a sketch of the shipping containers in the terminal. Blue rectangles represent loaded containers and gray rectangles represent empty containers.<br />
Note: your assistant does not have this specific sketch, so <strong>do not refer to these specific colors in your instruction </strong>(otherwise your assistant might think you are referring to the physical color of the containers).<br />
The length of the rectangles in the sketch is proportional to the physical length of the containers.</div>
