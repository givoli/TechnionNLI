# Unused Meta Data
The data in this directory is NOT part of the task presented in our paper. We provide it here just in case it would be useful for researchers who want to define new tasks using this dataset.

This data maps examples (from the training and test sets) to their associated interface method calls. This meta data is not used in our task in which only the desired state of the application is used as the supervision signal.
